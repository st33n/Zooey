        <h1>23. Do Not Think Good, Do Not Think Not-Good</h1>

        <p>When he became emancipated the sixth patriarch received from the fifth patriarch the bowl
        and robe given from the Buddha to his successors, generation after generation.</p>

        <p>A monk named E-myo out of envy pursued the patriarch to take this great treasure away from him.
        The sixth patriarch placed the bowl and robe on a stone in the road and told E-myo: 
        <em>"These objects just symbolize the faith. There is no use fighting over them.
          If you desire to take them, take them now."</em>

        <p>When E-myo went to move the bowl and robe they were as heavy as mountains. He could not
        budge them. Trembling for shame he said:

        <em>"I came wanting the teaching, not the material treasures. Please teach me."</em>
        </p>

        <p>The sixth patriarch said: <em>"When you do not think good and when you do not think
          not-good, what is your true self?"</em></p>

        <p>At these words E-myo was illumined. Perspiration broke out all over his body. He cried
        and bowed, saying: <em>"You have given me the secret words and meanings. Is there yet a
          deeper part of the teaching?"</em></p>

        <p>The sixth patriarch replied: <em>"What I have told you is no secret at all. When you
          realize your own true self the secret belongs to you."</em></p>

        <p>E-myo said: <em>"I was under the fifth patriarch many years but could not realize my
          true self until now. Through your teaching I find the source. A person drinks water and
          knows himself whether it is cold or warm. May I call you my teacher?"</em></p>

        <p>The sixth patriarch replied: <em>"We studied together under the fifth patriarch. Call
          him your teacher, but just treasure what you have attained."</em></p>

        Mumon's comment: The sixth patriarch certainly was kind in such an emergency. It was as
        if he removed the skin and seeds from the fruit and then, opening the pupil's mouth, let him eat.

        <blockquote>
          You cannot describe it, you cannot picture it,<br>
        You cannot admire it, you cannot sense it.<br>
        It is your true self, it has nowhere to hide.<br>
        When the world is destroyed, it will not be destroyed.<br>
        </blockquote>
